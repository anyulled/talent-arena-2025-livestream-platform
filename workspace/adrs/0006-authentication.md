# ADR-006: Ensuring Secure User Authentication & Access Control

Date: 2025-03-05

## Status

Proposed

## Context

User authentication must be secure, scalable, and support third-party integrations.

## Decision

* Implement OAuth 2.0 with AWS Cognito for authentication.
* Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management.
* Encrypt sensitive data using AWS KMS (Key Management Service).
* Apply role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.

## Consequences

* ✅ Secure user authentication and session handling.
* ✅ Supports third-party identity providers.
* ❌ Increased complexity in managing roles and access policies.
