# 5. Use Third-Parties for non-business critical parts

Date: 2024-01-15

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Developing these systems in-house would be resource-intensive. Leveraging third-party services can save time and provide specialized functionality.

## Decision

The system will integrate with third-party services for the Call For Papers (CFP) system and the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system.

## Consequences

* **Positive**: Access to established, feature-rich systems; reduced development time and cost.
* **Negative**: Dependency on external vendors; limitations based on the capabilities and constraints of the third-party systems.
