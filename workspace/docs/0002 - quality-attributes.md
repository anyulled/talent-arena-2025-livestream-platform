## System Quality attributes
[List of system quality attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes)

### Scalability
The system must handle varying loads, especially 'burst' traffic during conferences. This includes the ability to scale resources up or down as needed to accommodate the number of attendees and speakers accessing the system simultaneously.

### Performance
The system should provide quick response times and handle requests efficiently, especially important during peak usage times. This includes fast loading of schedules, smooth handling of talk submissions, and efficient processing of attendee votes.

### Availability
High availability is crucial, particularly during the conference. The system should be operational and accessible with minimal downtime.

### Reliability
The system should function correctly and provide consistent results. This includes accurate scheduling information, reliable voting mechanisms, and dependable notifications for schedule changes.

### Usability
The system must be user-friendly for attendees, speakers, sponsors, and event staff. This includes intuitive navigation, clear interfaces for talk submissions, voting, and schedule viewing.

### Security
Given that the system handles personal information of attendees and speakers, robust security measures are essential to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches. This includes securing sensitive data like contact information and talk content.

### Flexibility and Customizability
The system should allow for easy branding and customization for different conferences. This includes the ability to change themes, layouts, and branding elements for each event.

### Maintainability
The system should be easy to maintain and update, allowing for quick fixes, updates, and the addition of new features without significant downtime or disruption.

### Interoperability
Given the integration with third-party systems (like the CFP and CRM systems), the system must effectively interact and integrate with these external systems.
